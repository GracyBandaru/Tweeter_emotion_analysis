# Twitter Emotions Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes emotions expressed in tweets using machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It helps identify the emotional tone behind text data, such as happiness, sadness, anger, or neutrality. This tool can be used for social media monitoring, brand sentiment analysis, or understanding public opinion.

---

## Features
- Fetches and processes live tweets (or uses pre-saved datasets).
- Identifies and classifies emotions in textual data.
- Generates visualizations for emotional distribution.
- Customizable for different datasets and applications.

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, SpaCy, or transformers)
- Visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

---

## Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk transformers
```

### 2. Run the Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially:
```bash
jupyter notebook Tweeteremotions.ipynb
```

### 3. Configure Input Data
- Ensure you have API keys if fetching live tweets using the Twitter API.
- Modify the dataset path if using pre-saved data.

---

## Example Workflow
1. Preprocess the tweets: clean, tokenize, and remove noise.
2. Apply a pre-trained model or train a custom model for emotion detection.
3. Visualize the results using bar plots, pie charts, or word clouds.
